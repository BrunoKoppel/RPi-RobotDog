# Project "RobotDoge" 

## Personal Notes

This project was picked around the time I was gearing up for my internship at Boston Dynamics. Official Documentation and links to where to purchase the parts can be found below. *HOWEVER* The original code is buggy and may cause the program to crash specially when calibrating it, You can fix it by increasing the amount of decimals left out in the rounding math function in the Self.Calibrating function of the Servo.py file. There is also a Tutorial PDF in this repo so you could spin up your own project using this repo, However I recommmend using the original code to spin up your project, and use this as a reference.


## Chronology

- January: Robot Kit arrived, and later through out the month it was assembled.

- February 4: Robot was fully assembled and Code was build and tested on the Robot, however it ran into issues during calibration. There also was a smell of burned plastic after I came back from lunch and had left the robot standing on its legs.

- March 12: I've found out what was causing issues on the Leg #2, I've blew up one of the rotors in the robot back when I was first calibrating it. It didn't happened randomly, This mayb have been what the burned plastic smell was about. The leg rotors kept running (you can hear them buzzing) and this increased their temperature. The Kit is also pretty fragile and some pieces can break if not handle with care. However It's easy to buy more of this rotos online and they are pretty cheap (less than 10 bucks for one) I'll be purchasing one and replacing it.
